Ella is the codename behind my girthy NoScript rules and uBlock filter list, along with other rules for extensions I use over time. It is best run with uBlock Origin still installed, as some things will still depend on an external blocker.

## Installing
Open uBlock Origin, select "Filter Lists" and Import whatever URLs you have access to:
```
https://cdn.doamatto.xyz/ella.txt
```

If you want rules updated as they come out, use:
```
https://maatt.fr/ella.txt
https://pkgs.gouv.fa/misc/ublock-ella@latest.txt
```

Alternatively, you can embed the raw file URL for each of the text files inside the `rules/` folder.

## FAQ
### Who is Ella?
I wrote this Readme at 2 in the morning; I don't have a gosh dang diddly clue why I called it Ella.

### These are some odd sites..
Most of these sites are from a 1200 account 1Password vault of mine, with accounts dating back to 2013 (don't tell anyone though :wink:). There are a good amount of odd-balls.

### You're missing X site
Although I've scavenged a lot of the internet, I haven't seen it all. You can contribute with pull requests and issues and I'll continue to expand it. There are certain categories of sites I likely will either never add or never will go to, which include, but are not limited to:
- pornography,
- piracy sources,
- erotica sources,
- e-gambling and betting platforms; and:
- sites that are generally malicious or run by generally bad actors.

It is a pure ca-wink-a-dink if I happen to block resources on one of these sites.
